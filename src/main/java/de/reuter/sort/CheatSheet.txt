Merge Sort:
Split the array into smaller subarrays till pairs of elements are achieved, and then combine them in such a way that they are in order.

Heap Sort:
Build a max (or min) heap and extract the first element of the heap (or root), and then send it to the end of the heap.
Decrement the size of the heap and repeat till the heap has only one node.

Insertion Sort:
In every run, compare it with the predecessor.
If the current element is not in the correct location, keep shifting the predecessor subarray till the correct index for the element is found.

Selection Sort:
Find the minimum element in each run of the array and swap it with the element at the current index is compared.

Bubble Sort:
Keep swapping elements that are not in their right location till the array is sorted.
